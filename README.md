Hi! This project was created with ReactJs to consume the Poke API. The project includes:

- Login
- Home where you can view your favorite Pokémon either in table or grid form!
- Pokémon details page for the Pokémon of your choice!
- Search Pokémons!!!

## Note
This is a only-frontend project so various funcionalities are an empty shell
